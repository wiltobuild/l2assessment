- **No credit card required!**

### 2. Get Your API Key

Once logged in:

1. Go to: https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Customer Triage App")
4. Click "Submit"
5. **Copy the API key** - it starts with `gsk_`

**Important**: Save this key somewhere safe! You won't be able to see it again.

### 3. Add to Your Project

GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your-actual-key-here

2. Go to the "Analyze" tab
3. Paste a test message: "Our server is down"
4. Click "Analyze Message"
5. You should see AI-powered results!

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing credentials" Error

**Problem**: The app can't find your API key

**Solution**:
- Make sure file is named `.env.local` (not `.env`)
- Check that the key starts with `gsk_`
- Restart the dev server after adding the key
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the file

### "Rate limit exceeded" Error

**Problem**: You've hit the free tier limit

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Create a new Groq account with a different email
- Use the built-in mock responses (automatic fallback)

### Key Not Working

**Problem**: API returns 401 Unauthorized

**Solution**:
- Regenerate a new key at https://console.groq.com/keys
- Delete the old key
- Update `.env.local` with the new key
- Restart dev server

## Mock Mode (No API Key Needed)

If you don't want to use an API key, the app automatically falls back to **mock responses** when:
- No API key is configured
- API key is invalid
- Rate limit is exceeded

The mock mode uses realistic keyword-based categorization and works offline!

## Free Tier Limits

Groq's free tier includes:

- **~14,400 requests per day**
- **30 requests per minute**
- Access to multiple models including:
  - Llama 3.3 70B (what this app uses)
  - Llama 3.1 8B
  - Mixtral 8x7B
  - Gemma 2 9B

This is more than enough for development and testing!
